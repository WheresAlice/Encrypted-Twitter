Usage:

python twit.py -m "hello world" -k "This is a test key"
python twit.py --message="hello world" --key="This is a test key"

The key needs to be a multiple of 8 bytes (up to a maximum of 56)

The message should be short (the encrypted message needs to be less than 140 characters)

Security:

I believe this to be secure but don't offer any gaurantees.
You need to find a way of sharing the key safely.

Todo:

Write a script to decrypt these messages.  The code here is simply a proof of concept,
decryption will be added if anybody is insane enough to actually want to use it.
